Our team used the software R [@manual] to analyze the effect of cats on human emotion. @pongracz2018 discuss the important relationship between cats and humans, and some findings suggest that cats have a positive effect on human emotions [@bao2016; @galvan2016].

star_new <-star %>%

Overall, the average reading scores were lower, and had a lower standard deviation than student math scores. Girls also had a  higher average score than boys in both reading and math, and had a higher standard deviation in reading compared to boys, but a lower standard deviation in math. For both boys and girls, in reading and math, those who received free and reduced lunch had a lower average score

# Create the following plot, using whatever theme youâ€™d like, and briefly discuss it in text. (Note that might need to problem-solve how to put the legend at the bottom.)

```{r}
star <- star%>%
characterize

star <- star %>%
  mutate(frl = recode(
    frl,
    "no" = "Free/Reduced Price Meals",
    "yes" = "Paid Meals"
  ))

graph1 <- star%>%
  ggplot(aes(totexp, tmathss)) + 
  geom_point(color="gray", size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=frl),method= lm) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position ="bottom") +
  labs(color = "Free lunch")+
  labs(x = "Teacher Experience (Years)", 
       y = "Total Math Scale Scores",

       subtitle = "Separate regression lines displayed by free/reduced price lunch status")

graph1 + scale_fill_discrete(name="Free\nLunch")
